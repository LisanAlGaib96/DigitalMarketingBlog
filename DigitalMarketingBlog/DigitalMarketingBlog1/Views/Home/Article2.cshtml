                If you have a great idea for an app or software, starting a tech business might seem like the obvious choice.<br><br>

                But it’s not as simple as it seems. The world of technology can be intimidating for non-tech founders who may not understand the ins and outs of these products.<br><br>

                With the right preparation, skills, and support team, you can take a leap of faith and launch your own successful tech business.<br><br>

                So to start the prep, here are the top 5 challenges faced by the non-tech founders in 2023.
            </i><br><br>

            <h5>1. Finding a tech co-founder</h5><br>

            Every non-tech founder needs a technical counterpart who understands their visions and values.<br><br>

            There will be many tech maestros, but handpicking the one who understands you is never easy.<br><br>

            You’ll need a tech guy to help you with the product’s development costs and infrastructure. They can take the wheel while attending meetings with investors, incubators ...etc.<br><br>

            We are not explicitly saying that you can’t build tech without a technical partner, but it will be hard.  We’ve seen and helped companies out of the hole they dug themselves into due to the lack of tech expertise.<br><br>

            Here’s an interesting stat for you:<br>

            Companies with tech and non-tech founders perform 230% better.<br><br>

            <h5>2. Clear-Cut Roles and Responsibilities</h5><br>

            A founder is the first employee in a startup. As the company grows, they must clearly understand their roles and responsibilities.<br>

            Without the proper contribution, they will become a ghost from the past.<br><br>

            A great product won’t sell itself. You need proper market research and devise a plan that meets your customers’ needs. A non-tech founder can focus his attention on this business side of the company.<br><br>

            <h5>3. Hiring challenges</h5><br>

            You can find this challenge in almost every write-up with its reasons.<br><br>

            Hiring the right people is a crucial part of building a startup. Building a great team from scratch is a herculean task. Amidst all the traffic of product ideation, development, and launch, things get crazy.<br><br>

            The real challenge is understanding whether the person is right for the business in the long run. As a non-tech founder, you can’t assess a tech person’s skill with certainty, but you can assess his humane qualities.<br><br>

            According to CB Insights, not having the right team is among the top 20 reasons startups fail.<br><br>


            Developers are like wolves. They work effectively in a pack to skyrocket productivity. Hiring a developer team of devs with synergy is a great productivity hack that many don’t know.<br><br>

            Outsourcing your development process or integrating with devs is a great option you can try out. <br><br>

            <h5>4. Challenge of “unrealistic” deadlines and cost</h5><br>

            The deadlines that your PMs put in front of you might seem a bit far-fetched, and you feel they are slacking off.<br><br>

            In 90% of events, that’s not the case.<br><br>

            Development tasks take time, and as a non-tech person, it might be hard to wrap your head around it.<br><br>

            Unrealistic deadlines are realistic when it comes to building a quality product. Our wired super devs can vouch for that.<br><br>

            A good tech expert can help you out here. They can estimate what it would cost and how to cut down costs effectively.<br><br>

            <h5>5. Challenge of balancing business and product</h5><br>

            This is a mental trap for a founder, non-tech and tech alike.<br><br>

            While the business aspect is important, the product is the base of the business, and you need to focus on that too.<br><br>

            Ultimately the market becomes your primary concern. Whether your product or service is a solution, the market needs, or is it something you need to hard-sell?<br><br>

            Doing the proper research to meet the target market goals and tweaking your product to suit it.<br><br>

            The roller coaster ride begins when the business aspects affect your product’s identity. Balancing the scales will be the challenge waiting for you in the dark.<br><br>

            For example, the first iPhone was a product that balanced what the market wanted and with a unique identity. But the latest iPhone 14 is an overpriced market bait that lost its identity.<br><br>

            <h5>HOW TO TACKLE THESE CHALLANGES</h5><br>

            You can deal with challenges in your own way. If you hit a roadblock, here are a few hacks to power you through.<br><br>

            <h6><i>HACKS</i></h6><br>

            Know your product development process and your team. So that you can understand what they are capable of and how they are doing it.<br><br>

            Acquire basic knowledge like what APIs you use, the stacks…etc. so that you are on page with your PM.<br<br>

            Hail services from hiring agencies<br><br>

            Find a tech founder or a well-experienced CTO.<br><br>

            Build connections through social events like Techathons. Establish professional relations through social media platforms.<br><br>

            Surf websites like AngelList, CrowdForge, CoFoundersLab, etc., to find potential candidates.<br><br>

            <h6>TAKEAWAY</h6><br>

            Being a non-tech founder in a tech-savvy environment can be tricky, and these challenges will come to haunt you one at a time or all at once.<br><br>

            There are a lot more challenges that a non-tech founder may face along the way. The stages of MVP development will have challenges like what features to include, how to keep it within a budget and so on. The trick is to be prepared for anything.<br><br>

            These challenges in this write-up are rarely discussed, but those are faced by every non-tech founder alike in 2023.
